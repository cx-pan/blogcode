## Funny stuff

>“What's going on?” my mom said. 
“Oh, Nombuyiselo,” she said. “Trevor is so naughty. He's the naughtiest child I've ever come across in my life. ”
“Then you should hit him. ”
“I can't hit him. ” <br/>
“Why not?” 
“Because I don't know how to hit a white child,” she said. “A black child, I understand. A black child, you hit them and they stay black. Trevor, when you hit him he turns blue and green and yellow and red. I've never seen those colors before. I'm scared I'm going to break him. I don't want to kill a white person. I'm so afraid. I'm not going to touch him. ” <br/>

>For some reason the streets in Eden Park were named after cars: Jaguar Street. Ferrari Street. Honda Street. ...It was like living in a white neighborhood with all the streets named after varietals of fine wine. 

>All the other kids at school got brands, Nike and Adidas. I never got brands. One time I asked my mom for Adidas sneakers. She came home with some knockoff brand, Abidas. 
“Mom, these are fake,” I said. “I don't see the difference. ”<br/>
“Look at the logo. There are four stripes instead of three. ”
“Lucky you,” she said. “You got one extra. ”


>She spared no rod and spoiled no child. With Andrew, she was different. He got spankings at first, but they tapered off and eventually went away. When I asked her why I got beatings and Andrew didn't, she made a joke about it like she does with everything. “I beat you like that because you could take it,” she said. “I can't hit your little brother the same way because he's a skinny little stick. He'll break. But you, God gave you that ass for whipping. ”

>My mother used to tell me, “I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something that would love me unconditionally in return—and then I gave birth to the most selfish piece of shit on earth and all it ever did was cry and eat and shit and say, ‘Me, me, me, me me.' ”


>I was hyperactive, too. . . . My mom used to take me to the park so she could run me to death to burn off the energy. She'd take a Frisbee and throw it, and I'd run and catch it and bring it back. Over and over and over. Sometimes she'd throw a tennis ball. Black people's dogs don't play fetch; you don't throw anything to a black person's dog unless it's food. So it was only when I started spending time in parks with white people and their pets that I realized my mom was training me like a dog. 


>From an adult's point of view, I was destructive and out of control, but as a child I didn't think of it that way. I never wanted to destroy. I wanted to create. I wasn't burning my eyebrows. I was creating fire. I wasn't breaking overhead projectors. I was creating chaos, to see how people reacted. 


>And I couldn't help it. There's a condition kids suffer from, a compulsive disorder that makes them do things they themselves don't understand. You can tell a child, “Whatever you do, don't draw on the wall. You can draw on this paper. You can draw in this book. You can draw on any surface you want. But do not draw or write or color on the wall. ” The child will look you dead in the eye and say, “Got it. ” Ten minutes later the child is drawing on the wall. You start screaming. “Why the hell are you drawing on the wall?!” The child looks at you, and he genuinely has no idea why he drew on the wall. As a kid, I remember having that feeling all the time. Every time I got punished, as my mom was whooping my ass, I'd be thinking, Why did I just do that? I knew not to do that. She told me not to do that. Then once the hiding was over I'd say to myself, I'm going to be so good from here on. I'm never ever going to do a bad thing in my life ever ever ever ever ever—and to remember not to do anything bad, let me write something on the wall to remind myself…and then I would pick up a crayon and get straight back into it, and I never understood why. 

>In Soweto you were always hearing about men getting doused with pots of boiling water—often a woman's only recourse. And men were lucky if it was water. Some women used hot cooking oil. Water was if the woman wanted to teach her man a lesson. Oil meant she wanted to end it. 

>Dating girls may have been out of the question for me, but talking to them was not, because I could make them laugh. Human beings like to laugh, and lucky for me pretty girls are human beings. 

>One Sunday we were at the shops and there was a big display of toffee apples. I loved toffee apples, and I kept nagging her the whole way through the shop. “Please can I have a toffee apple? Please can I have a toffee apple? Please can I have a toffee apple? Please can I have a toffee apple?”
Finally, once we had our groceries and my mom was heading to the front to pay, I succeeded in wearing her down. “Fine,” she said. “Go and get a toffee apple. ” I ran, got a toffee apple, came back, and put it on the counter at the checkout. “Add this toffee apple, please,” I said. 
The cashier looked at me skeptically. “Wait your turn, boy. I'm still helping this lady. ”“No,” I said. “She's buying it for me. ”
My mother turned to me. “Who's buying it for you?”“You're buying it for me. ”
“No, no. Why doesn't your mother buy it for you?”“What? My mother? You are my mother. ”
“I'm your mother? No, I'm not your mother. Where's your mother?”I was so confused. “You're my mother. ”
The cashier looked at her, looked back at me, looked at her again. She shrugged, like, I have no idea what that kid's talking about. Then she looked at me like she'd never seen me before in her life. “Are you lost, little boy? Where's your mother?”
“Yeah,” the cashier said. “Where's your mother?”I pointed at my mother. “She's my mother. ”
“What? She can't be your mother, boy. She's black. Can't you see?”My mom shook her head. “Poor little colored boy lost his mother. What a shame. ”
I panicked. Was I crazy? Is she not my mother? I started bawling. “You're my mother. You're my mother. She's my mother. She's my mother. ”She shrugged again. “So sad. I hope he finds his mother. ”

>Whenever the principal would hit me, it was like he was afraid to do it too hard. One day I was getting a hiding and I thought, Man, if only my mom hit me like this, and I started laughing. I couldn't help it. The principal was quite disturbed. “If you're laughing while you're getting beaten,” he said, “then something is definitely wrong with you. ”
That was the first of three times the school made my mom take me to a psychologist to be evaluated. Every psychologist who examined me came back and said, “There's nothing wrong with this kid. ” I wasn't ADD. I wasn't a sociopath. I was just creative and independent and full of energy. The therapists did give me a series of tests, and they came to the conclusion that I was either going to make an excellent criminal or be very good at catching criminals, because I could always find loopholes in the law. Whenever I thought a rule wasn't logical, I'd find my way around it. 

>One morning before mass I decided, I'm going to get me some Jesus blood and Jesus body. I snuck behind the altar and I drank the entire bottle of grape juice and I ate the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other times that I couldn't. 
In my mind, I wasn't breaking the rules, because the rules didn't make any sense. And I got caught only because they broke their own rules. Another kid ratted me out in confession, and the priest turned me in. “No, no,” I protested. “You've broken the rules. That's confidential information. The priest isn't supposed to repeat what you say in confession. ”They didn't care. The school could break whatever rules it wanted. The principal laid into me. 
“What kind of a sick person would eat all of Jesus's body and drink all of Jesus's blood?”
“A hungry person. ”

>The only authority my mother recognized was God's. God is love and the Bible is truth—everything else was up for debate. She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her. 

>And then, under the golden arches, we kissed. It was my first time ever kissing a girl. It was just a peck, our lips touched for only a few seconds, but it set off explosions in my head. Yes! Oh, yes. This. I don't know what this is, but I like it. Something had awakened. And it was right outside McDonald's, so it was extra special. 

>My great-grandmother lived with us as well. We called her Koko. She was super old, well into her nineties, stooped and frail, completely blind. . . . Koko and my gran would sit and have long conversations, but as a five-year-old I didn't think of Koko as a real person. Since her body didn't move, she was like a brain with a mouth. Our relationship was nothing but command prompts and replies, like talking to a computer. 
“Good morning, Koko. ”“Good morning, Trevor. ”
“Koko, did you eat?”“Yes, Trevor. ”

>I never understood why my grandmother had a driveway. She didn't have a car. She didn't know how to drive. Yet she had a driveway. All of our neighbors had driveways, some with fancy, cast-iron gates. None of them had cars, either. There was no future in which most of these families would ever have cars. There was maybe one car for every thousand people, yet almost everyone had a driveway. It was almost like building the driveway was a way of willing the car to happen. The story of Soweto is the story of the driveways. It's a hopeful place. 


>Sadly, no matter how fancy you made your house, there was one thing you could never aspire to improve: your toilet. There was no indoor running water, just one communal outdoor tap and one outdoor toilet shared by six or seven houses. Our toilet was in a corrugated-iron outhouse shared among the adjoining houses. Inside, there was a concrete slab with a hole in it and a plastic toilet seat on top; there had been a lid at some point, but it had broken and disappeared long ago. We couldn't afford toilet paper, so on the wall next to the seat was a wire hanger with old newspaper on it for you to wipe. The newspaper was uncomfortable, but at least I stayed informed while I handled my business. 
The thing that I couldn't handle about the outhouse was the flies. It was a long drop to the bottom, and they were always down there, eating on the pile, and I had an irrational, all-consuming fear that they were going to fly up and into my bum. One afternoon, when I was around five years old, my gran left me at home for a few hours to go run errands. I was lying on the floor in the bedroom, reading. I needed to go, but it was pouring down rain. I was dreading going outside to use the toilet, getting drenched running out there, water dripping on me from the leaky ceiling, wet newspaper, the flies attacking me from below. Then I had an idea. Why bother with the outhouse at all? Why not put some newspaper on the floor and do my business like a puppy? That seemed like a fantastic idea. So that's what I did. I took the newspaper, laid it out on the kitchen floor, pulled down my pants, and squatted and got to it. 
When you shit, as you first sit down, you're not fully in the experience yet. You are not yet a shitting person. You're transitioning from a person about to shit to a person who is shitting. You don't whip out your smartphone or a newspaper right away. It takes a minute to get the first shit out of the way and get in the zone and get comfortable. Once you reach that moment, that's when it gets really nice. It's a powerful experience, shitting. There's something magical about it, profound even. I think God made humans shit in the way we do because it brings us back down to earth and gives us humility. I don't care who you are, we all shit the same. Beyoncé shits. The pope shits. The Queen of England shits. When we shit we forget our airs and our graces, we forget how famous or how rich we are. All of that goes away. 
You are never more yourself than when you're taking a shit. You have that moment where you realize, This is me. This is who I am. You can pee without giving it a second thought, but not so with shitting. Have you ever looked in a baby's eyes when it's shitting? It's having a moment of pure self-awareness. The outhouse ruins that for you. The rain, the flies, you are robbed of your moment, and nobody should be robbed of that. Squatting and shitting on the kitchen floor that day, I was like, Wow. There are no flies. There's no stress. This is really great. I'm really enjoying this. I knew I'd made an excellent choice, and I was very proud of myself for making it. I'd reached that moment where I could relax and be with myself. Then I casually looked around the room and I glanced to my left and there, just a few feet away, right next to the coal stove, was Koko. It was like the scene in Jurassic Park when the children turn and the T. rex is right there. Her eyes were wide open, cloudy white and darting around the room. I knew she couldn't see me, but her nose was starting to crinkle—she could sense that something was wrong. 
I panicked. I was mid-shit. All you can do when you're mid-shit is finish shitting. My only option was to finish as quietly and as slowly as I could, so that's what I decided to do. Then: the softest plop of a little-boy turd on the newspaper. Koko's head snapped toward the sound. “Who's there? Hallo? Hallo?!”
I froze. I held my breath and waited. “Who's there?! Hallo?!”
I kept quiet, waited, then started again. “Is somebody there?! Trevor, is that you?! Frances? Hallo? Hallo?”She started calling out the whole family. “Nombuyiselo? Sibongile? Mlungisi? Bulelwa? Who's there? What's happening?”
It was like a game, like I was trying to hide and a blind woman was trying to find me using sonar. Every time she called out, I froze. There would be complete silence. “Who's there?! Hallo?!” I'd pause, wait for her to settle back in her chair, and then I'd start up again. Finally, after what felt like forever, I finished. I stood up, took the newspaper—which is not the quietest thing—and I slowwwwwly folded it over. It crinkled. “Who's there?” Again I paused, waited. Then I folded it over some more, walked over to the rubbish bin, placed my sin at the bottom, and gingerly covered it with the rest of the trash. Then I tiptoed back to the other room, curled up on the mattress on the floor, and pretended to be asleep. The shit was done, no outhouse involved, and Koko was none the wiser. 
Mission accomplished. —


>“Sir, hospital can be very expensive. ”
“I don't care. ”“Sir, I don't think you understand. Hospital can be really expensive. ”
“Lady, I have money. I'll pay anything. Just help us. ”“Sir, you don't understand. We have to do so many tests. One test alone could cost two, three thousand rand. ”
“Three thousan—what? Lady, this is my mother's life we're talking about. I'll pay. ”“Sir, you don't understand. Your mother has been shot. In her brain. She'll be in ICU. One night in ICU could cost you fifteen, twenty thousand rand. ”
“Lady, are you not listening to me? This is my mother's life. This is her life. Take the money. Take all of it. I don't care. ”“Sir! You don't understand. I've seen this happen. Your mother could be in the ICU for weeks. This could cost you five hundred thousand, six hundred thousand. Maybe even millions. You'll be in debt for the rest of your life. ”
I'm not going to lie to you: I paused. I paused hard. In that moment, what I heard the nurse saying was, “All of your money will be gone,” and then I started to think, Well…what is she, fifty? That's pretty good, right? She's lived a good life.
