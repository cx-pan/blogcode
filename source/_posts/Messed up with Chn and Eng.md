_or let say how I need to combine two languages to shape a new "me". I need English as part of my identity._

For the past one month I was reading some books both in Chinese and English. It was so weird to read those translated literature, no matter it was from CHN to ENG or vice versa. I recently found out a heart-breaking truth that I was so unconfident in writing in Chinese. 

For one thing, English words popped up into my mind faster than Chinese, and I was not able to find a perfectly matched Chinese word for that because chinese words do not make sense to me for quite a while. I have been in close contact with English since I took English Education as my major 7 years ago, which also means that I rarely used Chinese apart from daily conversations. I wrote basically everything in English, including the homework, thesis, presentations etc., and there was a year when I seldom practiced Chinese (2015-2016). At the beginning of the exchange, I constantly found out that the muscles in my mouth were so exhausted. Later I realized I was speaking this foreign language every day that I finally was training my muscles to be accustomed to English, because every language uses different part of the muscles to certain extend. That was the turning point when I am detached from my mother tongue, I think.

For another, My Chinese wasn't good through out my life. I wrote it with numerous grammar mistakes and am not able to use more formal expressions. I always wrote Chinese essasy colloquially, which is not acceptable to me. Sadly, I have no heart to improve my Chinese writing, because I don't see an end, and when I can reach to a satsifying level. Now, with both English and Chinese expressions in my mind, lots of Chinese words do not make sense to me. I came to realize that although some words can be translated such as some nouns, many words have their own meaning in original language that cannot be fully translated and understood in another language. For example, when I use "tricky" to describe a thing, I want to say it's 复杂又微妙的, but this expression did not fully expressed my feelings. Or let say, My Chinese wasn't proficient enough, resulting in my failure of figuring out a better word.

I understand why bilingual people intertwined two languages together unconsciously. If people don't understand this phenomenon, they wouldn't understand me, but misinterpret this as "showing off" my second language. Anyway, I feel more motivated to further improve my English proficiency, rather than Chinese. I like Chinese too, but English opens a bigger world for me. I feel connected to the rest of the world.

English as the priority and maybe the dominant language for me, I also want to polish my German, and learn new languages including Japanese, French, Arabic.

Sometimes I don't want to abuse Chinese. It was awkward to use it.

Having been back to China for over half a year, Chinese finally became the dominant language again, and I feel more confident in writing it. I think now I should keep in mind that read and write both Chinese and English. I will panic for sure once I realize my English is declining.
