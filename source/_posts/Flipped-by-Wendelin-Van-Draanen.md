>I told him about his eyes and his hair and the way his cheeks blush, but I don't think I explained it very well because when I was done Dad shook his head and told me in soft, heavy words that I needed to start looking at the whole landscape. ..."Proper lighting is everything."

>Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss... but every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.

>...when I told about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. 'It's that way with people too, only with people it's some times that the whole is less than the sum of the parts.'

>Get beyond his eyes his smile and the sheen of his hair - look at what's really there.

> To be held above the earth and brushed by the wind, it's like you heart has been kissed by beauty. --about the sycamore tree

whole less than the part, 若给颜值，才华，人品，性格等每一项打分，有人单项得分很高，却可能严重偏科，导致总体平均分低。

学生时代，喜欢一个人可能是这个人帅气的脸庞，娟秀的字，修长的手指，擅长打篮球，但是随着年龄增长，曾经可以因为一个人白皙修长手指就心动的感觉早已消逝，青春时代的爱情很简单，但我更喜欢成熟的爱情。对啊，这种成熟也表现于能够看到一个人的全部。

Flipped里最具有教育意义的应该是Juli温暖有爱的一家。父亲的弟弟因为出生时窒息导致智力发育迟缓，父亲成家后把弟弟送去私人疗养院保证弟弟有个好的生活环境，而不是把弟弟送去政府救济中心。
Juli因为Bryce的外表而疯狂痴迷于他，父亲也没有阻止，父亲只是建议女儿看一个人，should look at the whole landscape.
两个儿子高中时在家里自己组建乐队，创作音乐，录制demo，父母表示了全力的支持，并且以此为傲。餐桌上常常听得到他们兄弟俩的歌声，父母投去赞赏的目光。
Juli因为在学校受挫，回家母亲发现女儿心情不好，想知道原因，但女儿一开始不太愿意表达出来。妈妈也没有强求，
家里每个人都有同理心，Juli即使千百般不想去Beyce家吃饭，最后也去了，因为母亲真的非常期待，她不希望破坏母亲的心情。

最后，虽然Juli和Bryce终于能像正常人一样做朋友甚至我想象的男女朋友，我还是觉得Juli deserves better. Bryce is a coward， but, who knows, maybe he grows up in the end.
